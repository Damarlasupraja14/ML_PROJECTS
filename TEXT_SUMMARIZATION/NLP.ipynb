      " Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science and a subfield of artificial intelligence that aims to make computers understand human language. NLP uses computational linguistics, which is the study of how language works, and various models based on statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. These technologies allow computers to analyze and process text or voice data, and to grasp their full meaning, including the speaker’s or writer’s intentions and emotions.  NLP powers many applications that use language, such as text translation, voice recognition, text summarization, and chatbots. You may have used some of these applications yourself, such as voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text software, and customer service bots. NLP also helps businesses improve their efficiency, productivity, and performance by simplifying complex tasks that involve language.\n",
